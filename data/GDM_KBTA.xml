			<p gate:gateId="5">Pregnancy is characterized by insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia, thus it may predispose some women to develop diabetes. The resistance stems from placental secretion of diabetogenic hormones including growth hormone, corticotropin releasing hormone, placental lactogen, and progesterone, as well as increased maternal adipose deposition, decreased exercise, and increased caloric intake. These and other endocrinologic and metabolic changes ensure that the fetus has an ample supply of fuel and nutrients at all times. Gestational diabetes occurs when pancreatic function is not sufficient to overcome the insulin resistance created by changes in diabetogenic hormones during pregnancy.</p>
			<p gate:gateId="6">Several adverse outcomes have been associated with diabetes during pregnancy. Importantly, the risk of these outcomes increases continuously as maternal fasting plasma glucose levels increase. However, there is no clear threshold that defines patients at increased risk. Adverse outcomes include: 
				<ul gate:gateId="7">

				</ul>If maternal hyperglycemia is present during organogenesis because of overt (also termed pregestational) diabetes, there is an increased risk of miscarriage and congenital anomalies.</p>
			<h1 gate:gateId="16">Definition and diagnostic criteria</h1>
			<p gate:gateId="17">Gestational diabetes is defined as carbohydrate intolerance that begins or is first recognized during pregnancy. In 2010, the International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Group (IADPSG), recommended to classified it in two subtypes:</p>
			<ol gate:gateId="18" type="a">
				<li gate:gateId="19">overt diabetes, which is defined with the same criteria than in general population but during the initial prenatal visit (Note: These patients will not be considered in MobiGuide): 
					<ul gate:gateId="20">
						<li gate:gateId="21">Fasting plasma glucose ≥ 126 mg/dL [7.0 mmol/L], or</li>
						<li gate:gateId="22">A1C ≥ 6.5 percent using a standardized assay, or</li>
						<li gate:gateId="23">Random plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL [11.1 mmol/] that is subsequently confirmed by elevated fasting plasma glucose or A1C, as noted above</li></ul>
				</li>
				<li gate:gateId="24">Gestational diabetes.

					<p gate:gateId="25">The diagnostic criteria for gestational diabetes have been a matter of debate since the publication of the IADPSG recommendations in 2010. The recommendation is based on outcome data reported in the HAPO study.</p>
					<p gate:gateId="26">The Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcome (HAPO) study included more than 23,000 pregnant women. After a 75-g oral two-hour glucose tolerance test, the risk of macrosomia increased as much as five-fold as fasting blood glucose concentration increased above 75 mg/dL (4.2 mmol/L), or one-hour glucose concentration increased above 105 mg/dL (5.8 mmol/L), or two-hour glucose concentration increased above 90 mg/dL (5.0 mmol/L), and the risk increased continuously across the spectrum of glucose results. There was also a positive, but weaker, correlation between increasing glucose concentration and maternal complications (eg, preeclampsia) and neonatal metabolic morbidity (eg, hypoglycemia, hyperbilirubinemia), but not long-term childhood morbidity, such as obesity at age two years in a small subset of offspring. Of note, women with significant hyperglycemia were excluded from the HAPO analysis (exclusion criteria: fasting glucose concentration greater than 105 mg/dL [5.8 mmol/L], two-hour glucose concentration greater than 200 mg/dL [11.1 mmol/L], or a random glucose concentration later in gestation greater than 160 mg/dL [8.9 mmol/L]).</p>
					<p gate:gateId="27">On the light of the results of the HAPO study, the International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG) and the American Diabetes Association proposed criteria for Gestational Diabetes based on the results of the 75-gram Glucose tolerance test</p>

					<p gate:gateId="46">The thresholds represent the glucose values at which the odds of infant birth weight, cord C-peptide (proxy for fetal insulin level), and percent body fat &gt;90 percentile were 1.75 times the estimated odds of these outcomes at mean glucose levels, based on fully adjusted logistic regression models. Compared to women in the HAPO study with all glucose values below the thresholds, women who exceeded one or more of these thresholds had a two-fold higher frequency of large for gestational age infants and preeclampsia, and &gt;45 percent increase in preterm delivery and primary cesarean delivery. Using an odds ratio of 2 for the thresholds defined a population with further increased frequencies of these outcomes, but the increase was modest and resulted in failure to identify many women who were at almost comparable risk.</p>
					<p gate:gateId="47">However, although the ADA has assumed the IADPSG recommendations, the American College of Obstetrics and gynecologists (ACOG) does not recommend this approach &quot;because there is no evidence that diagnosis using these criteria leads to clinically significant improvements in maternal or newborn outcomes and it would lead to a significant increase in health care costs&quot;.</p>
					<p gate:gateId="48">The National Institute of Health is planning a Consensus Development Conference to determine the optimal approach to screening and diagnosis in the United States.</p>
					<p gate:gateId="49">Thus, in this guideline we are going to maintain the recommendations for diagnosis made by the Spanish Group for the study of Diabetes and Pregnancy which agree with the recommendations from the ACOG:</p>

			<h1 gate:gateId="95">Rationale for treatment</h1>
			<p gate:gateId="96">Identifying women with GDM is important because meta-analysis of randomized trials has shown that appropriate therapy can decrease maternal and fetal morbidity, particularly macrosomia. The value of treatment of GDM was best illustrated in two large trials that randomly assigned women with mild GDM to a regimen of either diet/blood glucose monitoring/insulin as needed or routine obstetrical care. One trial was performed in Australia and the other in the United States. Both trials observed that treatment resulted in a significant decrease in the prevalence of macrosomia (US trial: 6 versus 14 percent with usual care; Australian trial: 10 versus 21 percent with usual care), and the reduction in macrosomia was associated with a significant decrease in shoulder dystocia in one trial and the composite outcome of shoulder dystocia, nerve palsy, bone fracture, and death in the other. The rate of cesarean delivery was significantly reduced in the treatment group of one trial, and not increased in the other trial, although an increase is often observed in women with gestational diabetes. Treatment did not lead to a significant reduction in the prevalence of neonatal metabolic abnormalities (eg, hypoglycemia, hyperbilirubinemia) in either trial. Fetal/neonatal death was rare in all groups in both trials.</p>
			<p gate:gateId="97">Both trials reported lower pregnancy weight gain in the treated group than in the control group. The US trial also reported a significant decrease in the rates of preeclampsia and gestational hypertension in the treatment group (8.6 versus 13.6 percent with usual care) and the Australian trial noted a significantly reduced rate of gestational hypertension (12 versus 18 percent with usual care).</p>

Results should be recorded in a glucose log, along with dietary information. This facilitates recognition of glycemic patterns and helps immeasurably in interpreting results stored in the memory of modern meters. Multiple daily measurements allow recognition of women who should begin insulin therapy and appear to decrease the risk of macrosomia. The decision to start insulin therapy (or not to start it) is taken by the endocrinologist. Note: in some not very frequent cases, the insulin therapy is not started after considering the

			<p gate:gateId="195">Long-acting insulin analogs (insulin glargine, insulin detemir) have not been studied extensively in pregnancy. However, insulin detemir has been recently approved by the EMEA for the treatment of women with diabetes and pregnancy. In vitro perfusion studies have demonstrated that insulin glargine does not cross the placenta, however, concern about transplacental transfer of glargine in vivo remains. Based on available data, we prefer use of human NPH insulin as part of a multiple injection regimen in pregnant women with GDM.</p>
			<h3 gate:gateId="196">Oral anti-hyperglycemic agents</h3>
			<p gate:gateId="197">A systematic review by the Johns Hopkins University Evidence-based Practice Center for the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality presented evidence from randomized trials and observational studies that:</p>
			<ol gate:gateId="198">
				<li gate:gateId="199">maternal glucose levels did not differ substantially between gravidae treated with insulin versus those treated with oral glucose-lowering agents, and</li>
				<li gate:gateId="200">there was no consistent evidence of an increase in any adverse maternal or neonatal outcome with use of glyburide, acarbose, or metformin compared with use of insulin.</li>
			</ol>
			<p gate:gateId="201">The ADA and ACOG do not endorse the use of oral anti-hyperglycemic agents during pregnancy and such therapy has not been approved by the Unites States Food and Drug Administration for treatment of GDM. We concur, but metformin may be a good complement to diet (plus insulin if required) in obese women. This should be personalized according to each patient's characteristics. However, metformin crosses the placenta and, in one study, cord arterial levels were twice as high as maternal venous levels.</p>
			<h1 gate:gateId="202">Obstetric management</h1>
			<p gate:gateId="203">Obstetric management will be similar to the usually applied for non GDM women. However, it is advised to add an additional US study during 28-32 gestational week to detect macrosomia.</p>
			<h2 gate:gateId="204">Peripartum management</h2>
			<p gate:gateId="205">Maternal hyperglycemia should be avoided during labor to reduce the risk of fetal acidosis and neonatal hypoglycemia. The risk of adverse neonatal metabolic outcomes (hypoglycemia, hyperbilirubinemia, hypocalcemia, erythremia) is related to both antepartum and intrapartum maternal hyperglycemia and appears to increase with the degree of maternal hyperglycemia. A protocol for intrapartum metabolic control is being applied which includes e.v. insulin perfusion/ dextrose serum. However, for almost all women with gestational diabetes, no insulin treatment is needed during labour and we are going to review this part of the protocol in order to simplify it.</p>
			<h1 gate:gateId="206">Future risks</h1>
			<p gate:gateId="207">Most women with GDM are normoglycemic after delivery. However, they are at high risk for recurrent GDM, prediabetes (impaired glucose tolerance or impaired fasting glucose), and overt diabetes over the subsequent five years.</p>
			<h2 gate:gateId="208">Recurrence</h2>
			<p gate:gateId="209">One-third to two-thirds of women with GDM will have GDM in a subsequent pregnancy. Women who have a recurrence tend to be older, more parous, and have a greater increase in weight between their pregnancies than women without a recurrence. Higher infant birth weight in the index pregnancy and higher maternal prepregnancy weight have also been associated with recurrent GDM.</p>
			<h2 gate:gateId="210">Long-term risk of diabetes</h2>
			<p gate:gateId="211">A history of GDM is predictive of an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, type 1 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.</p>
			<ul gate:gateId="212">
				<li gate:gateId="213">As many as 20 percent of women with GDM have impaired glucose tolerance during the early postpartum period.</li>
				<li gate:gateId="214">A systematic review and meta-analysis found that women with GDM were at significantly higher risk of developing subsequent type 2 diabetes than women with normoglycemic pregnancies (RR 7.43, 95% CI 4.79-11.51; 20 cohort studies including 675,455 women of who 10,859 had type 2 diabetes). The relative risk was 4.69 within the first five years after delivery and 9.34 more than five years after delivery.

					. Additional risk factors for impaired glucose tolerance and overt diabetes later in life include autoantibodies (eg, glutamic acid decarboxylase, insulinoma antigen-2), high fasting blood glucose concentrations during pregnancy and early postpartum, higher fasting blood glucose at diagnosis of GDM and high glucose levels in oral glucose tolerance testing, neonatal hypoglycemia, and GDM in more than one pregnancy. Parity, large birth weight, and diabetes in a first-degree relative are less correlated with later diabetes.</li>
				<li gate:gateId="216">GDM is also a risk factor for the development of type 1 diabetes, particularly in populations with a high prevalence of this disorder. In our country there is no recent data but one study found that more than 13% of women with GDM have positivity to islet cell antibodies (ICA). Thus, if there is suspected the possibility of type 1 diabetes, determination of plasma autoimmune markers are mandatory (GAD65 Ab; IAA).</li>
