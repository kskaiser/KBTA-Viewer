<p gate:gateId="9">Major Recommendations</p>

<p gate:gateId="10"><b gate:gateId="11">Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC) and the Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement (ICSI):</b> For a description of what has changed since the previous version of this guidance, refer to Summary of Changes Report - April 2012 . In addition, ICSI has made a decision to transition to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. This document is in transition to the GRADE methodology. Transition steps incorporating GRADE methodology for this document include the following:</p>
<ul gate:gateId="12"><li gate:gateId="13">Priority placed upon available systematic reviews in literature searches.</li>
<li gate:gateId="14">All existing Class A (randomized controlled trials [RCTs]) studies have been considered as high quality evidence unless specified differently by a work group member.</li>
<li gate:gateId="15">All existing Class B, C and D studies have been considered as low quality evidence unless specified differently by a work group member.</li>
<li gate:gateId="16">All existing Class M and R studies are identified by study design versus assigning a quality of evidence. (Refer to Crosswalk between ICSI Evidence Grading System and GRADE below in the &quot;Definitions&quot; section).</li>
<li gate:gateId="17">All new literature considered by the work group for this revision has been assessed using GRADE methodology.</li>
</ul>
<p gate:gateId="18">The recommendations for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus are presented in the form of 2 algorithms with a total of 24 components, accompanied by detailed annotations. Algorithms are provided in the original guideline document for: Diagnosis and Management of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (main algorithm) and Glycemic Control; clinical highlights and selected annotations (numbered to correspond with the algorithm) follow.</p>

<p gate:gateId="19">Class of evidence (Low Quality, Moderate Quality, High Quality, Meta-analysis, Systematic Review, Decision Analysis, Cost-Effectiveness Analysis, Guideline, and Reference) and conclusion grade (I-III, Not Assignable) definitions are repeated at the end of the &quot;Major Recommendations&quot; field.</p>
<h3 gate:gateId="20">Clinical Highlights</h3>
<ul gate:gateId="21"><li gate:gateId="22">Education and self-management support is necessary for people with prediabetes and diabetes to manage their disease. (Annotation #10)</li>
<li gate:gateId="23">Focus on cardiovascular risk reduction (blood pressure control, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol control and statin use, aspirin use and tobacco cessation). (Annotations #11, 13, 14)</li>
<li gate:gateId="24">Glycosylated hemoglobin (A1c) levels should be individualized to the patient. (Annotation #11)</li>
<li gate:gateId="25">Aggressive blood pressure control is just as important as glycemic control. Systolic blood pressure level should be the major factor for detection, evaluation, and treatment of hypertension. The use of two or more blood pressure lowering agents is often required to meet blood pressure goal. (Annotations #13, 14 )</li>
<li gate:gateId="26">Prevent microvascular complications through annual or biannual eye exams, foot risk assessments and foot care counseling, and annual screening for proteinuria. (Annotation # 18)</li>
<li gate:gateId="27">Initial therapy with lifestyle treatment and metformin is advised unless contraindicated. (Annotations #3, 10)</li>

<p gate:gateId="198">Medical nutrition therapy for diabetes emphasizes improving metabolic outcomes by modifying nutrient intake and lifestyle. Major goals are to attain and maintain in the normal or as close to normal range as is safely possible glucose, blood pressure, and lipid/lipoprotein levels. These prevent or slow the development of chronic complications of diabetes [Guideline].</p>

<p gate:gateId="199">The priority for nutrition therapy for type 2 diabetes is to implement lifestyle strategies that will reduce hyperglycemia and hypertension and improve dyslipidemias [Guideline]. Because many individuals are insulin resistant and overweight or obese, nutrition therapy often begins with strategies that reduce energy intake and increase energy expenditure through physical activity. Many individuals may have already tried unsuccessfully to lose weight and it is important to note that lifestyle strategies, independent of weight loss, can improve glucose control and risk factors for cardiovascular disease.</p>

<p gate:gateId="200">Moderate weight loss (5% of body weight) is associated with decreased insulin resistance, improved measures of glycemia and lipidemia, and reduced blood pressure. The optimal macronutrient distribution of weight loss diets has not been established.</p>

<p gate:gateId="201">Restricting total carbohydrate to less than 130 g/day is not recommended in the management of diabetes [Guideline].</p>

<p gate:gateId="273">Weight loss is also an important goal because it improves insulin resistance, glycemic control, blood pressure and lipid profiles. Moderate weight loss (5% of body weight) can improve fasting blood glucose in many overweight or obese persons [Narrative Review].</p>

<p gate:gateId="274">Physical activity and behavior modification are important components of weight loss programs and are most helpful in maintenance of weight loss.</p>

<p gate:gateId="275">Structured programs that emphasize lifestyle changes including education, reduced energy and fat intake (approximately 30% of total energy), regular physical activity and frequent participant contact are necessary to produce long-term weight loss of 5% to 7% of starting weight. Lifestyle change should be the primary approach to weight loss [Guideline].</p>

<p gate:gateId="276">Identification of the optimal mix of macronutrients for diabetes meal plans is unlikely. The best mix of carbohydrate, protein and fat appears to vary depending on individual circumstances but must be appropriate for individual metabolic status, total calories for weight management goal and/or food preferences.

<h6 gate:gateId="282">Education for Self-Management</h6>

<p gate:gateId="283">Adequate self-management support for patients requires integration of available self-management education and support resources into routine care. Usually appropriate education may require the expertise of the diabetes educator. This instruction can be obtained through individual or group consultation [Low Quality Evidence]. Medicare reimbursement for diabetes self-management training requires this service be provided by an education program that has achieved recognition by the American Diabetes Association or American Association of Diabetes Educators; the staff in such a program are multidisciplinary and include at least a registered dietitian and a registered nurse with experiential preparation in education and diabetes management [Low Quality Evidence]. A number of studies involving a clinical pharmacist in program with cardiac risk factors in select patients with diabetes have proven to be effective [Low Quality Evidence]. Clinicians should be aware of culturally appropriate educational and community resources to support persons with diabetes and their families.</p>

<h6 gate:gateId="312">Community Resources</h6>

<p gate:gateId="313">There is some evidence for the effectiveness of community-based diabetes self-management education and support. These programs may complement the care and education that are routinely part of standard medical practice, and may enhance a patient&apos;s ability to self-manage diabetes. The Task Force on Community Preventive Services, supported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, recommends diabetes self-management education in community gathering places.</p>
<h4 gate:gateId="314">Set Personalized A1c Goal: A1c Less Than 7% or Individualized to a Goal Less Than 8% Based on Factors in 11a</h4>
<p>(see the algorithm box 11a in the original guideline document)</p> 
<h5 gate:gateId="315">Recommendations:</h5>
<ul gate:gateId="316"><li gate:gateId="317">Set personalized A1c goal to less than 7% or less than 8% based on the risks and benefits for each patient.
<br gate:gateId="1529"></br>This recommendation places high value on trying to optimize the balance of risks versus benefits of more intensive glycemic control for each individual. Potential risks of &lt;7% may include higher mortality rates, hypoglycemia, and weight gain. Potential benefits may include lower risk of diabetes complications such as retinopathy, nephropathy and heart disease. Individual patient factors that may increase risks include known cardiovascular disease, history of severe hypoglycemia, polypharmacy-related challenges, limited life expectancy, cognitive impairment and extensive comorbid conditions.</li>
<li gate:gateId="319">Blood glucose goals should be individualized according to the patient&apos;s A1c goals and treatment plan.
<br gate:gateId="1530"></br>This recommendation places a high value on using self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG) values to guide treatment decisions, but this benefit may not be equal for patients and is probably more helpful in patients having trouble reaching or sustaining A1c goals and in those treated with insulin. This recommendation places a relatively low value on the burden and cost of SMBG testing.</li>
</ul>
<p gate:gateId="321">A1c target in type 2 diabetes is aimed at reducing microvascular complications while not increasing risk of morbidity or mortality. All patients with type 2 diabetes should aim to achieve an A1c less than 8%. This will reduce microvascular disease and not increase risk substantially. Many patients with type 2 diabetes may derive additional benefit in reduction of microvascular disease by reaching a target A1c less than 7% and not increase risks as long as the target is not A1c less than 6%. For patients with type 2 diabetes and the following factors, an A1c goal of less than 8% may be more appropriate than an A1c goal of less than 7% [High Quality Evidence], [Moderate Quality Evidence]. [Conclusion Grade II: See Conclusion Grading Worksheet B - Annotation #11 (A1c) in the original guideline document].</p>
<ul gate:gateId="322">
	<li gate:gateId="323">Known cardiovascular disease or high risk cardiovascular risk. Cardiovascular risk can be determined by the Framingham or the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) risk equations, or alternatively as having two or more cardiovascular risks (BMI &gt;30, hypertension, dyslipidemia, smoking and microalbuminuria).</li>

</ul>
<p gate:gateId="329">The clinician and patient should discuss and document specific treatment goals and develop a plan to achieve all desired goals. A multifactorial approach to diabetes care that includes emphasis on blood pressure, lipids, glucose, aspirin use, and non-use of tobacco will maximize health outcomes far more than a strategy that is limited to just one or two of these clinical domains [Guideline], [Moderate Quality Evidence], [High Quality Evidence].</p>
<h6 gate:gateId="330">Glycosylated Hemoglobin Assays</h6>

<p gate:gateId="331">Glycosylated hemoglobin assays provide an accurate indication of long-term glycemic control. A1c is formed by the continuous non-enzymatic glycosylation of hemoglobin throughout the lifespan of an erythrocyte. This assay yields an accurate measure of time-averaged blood glucose during the previous six to eight weeks. Clinically it can assist in determining duration and severity of hyperglycemia and can help guide treatment.</p>

<p gate:gateId="332">Eating, physical activity or acute metabolic stress do not influence the A1c test. The test can be done at any time of day and does not require fasting.</p>

<p gate:gateId="333">Glucose should also be used to assess level of glycemic control, in addition to A1c. It is appropriate to determine need for medication changes based on blood glucose whenever this information is available.</p>
<h6 gate:gateId="334">Self-Monitoring Blood Glucose (SMBG)</h6>

<p gate:gateId="335">Major clinical trials assessing the impact of glycemic control on diabetes complications have included SMBG as part of multifactorial interventions, suggesting that self-monitoring blood glucose is a component of effective therapy [Guideline]. Several diabetes management strategies reliant on SMBG testing have demonstrated improved glucose control in patients [High Quality Evidence], [Moderate Quality Evidence]. Refer to Table 1 in the original guideline document for information on ranges of self-monitored glucose readings that would be expected as goals for patients with the corresponding A1c levels. More than half of the plasma blood glucose readings should fall in the desired goal range. Bedtime glucose goals vary dependent on the patient&apos;s treatment program, risks for hypoglycemia and time after last meal.</p>

<p gate:gateId="336">Self-monitoring blood glucose allows patients to evaluate their individual response to therapy and assess whether glucose targets are being achieved. Results of SMBG can be useful in preventing hypoglycemia and adjusting medications, medical nutrition therapy and physical activity [Low Quality Evidence].</p>

<p gate:gateId="337">The frequency and timing of SMBG should be dictated by the particular needs and goals of the individual patient. Patients with type 2 diabetes on insulin typically need to perform SMBG more frequently than those not using insulin, particularly if using glucose readings to guide mealtime insulin dosing. It is recommended that patients using multiple insulin injections perform SMBG three or more times daily [Guideline]. The optimal frequency and timing of SMBG for patients with type 2 diabetes on oral agent therapy are not known but should be sufficient to facilitate reaching glucose goals. SMBG should be performed more frequently when adding or modifying therapy; two-hour postprandial glucose testing is useful in some patients. The role of SMBG in stable diet-treated patients with type 2 diabetes is not known.</p>

<p gate:gateId="338">Because the accuracy of SMBG is instrumental and user dependent, it is important for health care clinicians to evaluate each patient&apos;s monitoring technique and accuracy of equipment. In addition, optimal use of SMBG requires proper interpretation of the data. Patients should be taught how to use the data to adjust food intake, exercise or pharmacological therapy to achieve specific glycemic goals.</p>

<p gate:gateId="339">See the original guideline document for information on ranges of self-monitored blood glucose values for various A1c goals.</p>

<h5 gate:gateId="341">Recommendations:</h5>

<p gate:gateId="342">The following treatment goals should be achieved:</p>
<ol gate:gateId="343"><li gate:gateId="344">Use of statins in all adult type 2 diabetes patients if tolerated; statins should be titrated to achieve low-density lipoprotein cholesterol of less than 100 mg/dL without coronary artery disease.</li>
<li gate:gateId="345">Blood pressure less than 140/90 mm Hg.</li>
<li gate:gateId="346">Smoking cessation if indicated.</li>
<li gate:gateId="347">Daily aspirin use is optional for primary prevention of cardiovascular events.</li>
</ol>
<p gate:gateId="348">This recommendation places a high value on a multifactorial approach to lowering the cardiovascular risk of patients with diabetes. The recommendation does not place value on prioritizing these treatment interventions, and some may be more important than others for different individuals. For the lipid and blood pressure recommendations, there is low value placed on the burden of these treatment approaches, the age of the patient (the evidence is less established in patients under age 40 and over 75), and whether patients can tolerate the treatments needed to obtain the recommended goals without side effects. The aspirin recommendation places high value on assessing an individual&apos;s age and risk of bleeding related to aspirin use prior to recommending it for primary prevention.</p>

<p gate:gateId="349">The clinician and patient should discuss and document specific treatment goals and develop a plan to achieve all desired goals. A multifactorial approach to diabetes care that includes emphasis on blood pressure, lipids, glucose, aspirin use and non-use of tobacco will maximize health outcomes far more than a strategy that is limited to just one or two of these clinical domains [Guideline], [Moderate Quality Evidence], [High Quality Evidence].</p>

<p gate:gateId="351">Seventy to seventy-five percent of adult patients with diabetes die of macrovascular disease, specifically coronary, carotid and/or peripheral vascular disease. Diabetes is considered a coronary artery disease equivalent. Dyslipidemia is a known risk factor for macrovascular disease. Patients with diabetes develop more atherosclerosis than patients without diabetes with the same quantitative lipoprotein profiles. In most patients with diabetes, use of a statin can reduce major vascular events in patients with diabetes substantially [High Quality Evidence]. Beneficial effects of statins on cardiovascular risk reduction may go beyond their effects on lipid levels.</p>

[Conclusion Grade I: See Conclusion Grading Worksheet C - Annotations #13, 14 (Statin Use) in the original guideline document]. However, doses of simvastatin greater than 40 mg may potentially increase risk of myopathy [High Quality Evidence]. Evidence [High Quality Evidence] and Adult Treatment Panel III consensus guidelines [Low Quality Evidence] suggest that statins are beneficial for high-risk patients ages 40 to 80 years with a 10-year risk of cardiovascular event of more than 20% based on Framingham or UKPDS risk calculators, even with baseline untreated low-density lipoprotein of less than 100 mg/dL [Low Quality Evidence].</p>

If the LDL goal cannot be met with high-dose statin therapy, there is not current evidence to prove that adding LDL-lowering drug classes will improve outcomes for people with diabetes. A combination of statin and ezetimibe versus statin monotherapy has not been proven advantageous.</p>

<p gate:gateId="364">High triglycerides and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels are independent risk factors for cardiovascular disease in the patient with diabetes [Guideline]. Individuals with elevated triglycerides have significant cardiovascular risk reduction with the use of fibrates [High Quality Evidence] or statins [High Quality Evidence].</p>

<p gate:gateId="365">The current evidence does not support the use of combination therapy with statins and other lipid drugs for most patients with type 2 diabetes. The combination of statin plus ezetimibe versus statin monotherapy has not been proven advantageous [High Quality Evidence]. The National Institutes of Health-sponsored ACCORD lipid study showed no significant reduction in myocardial infarct, stroke or cardiovascular death with a fibrate-statin combination compared to statin monotherapy. However, a subgroup analysis of the primary outcome suggested that there was a gender effect with a possible benefit for men and possible harm for women, as well as a possible benefit for men and women with both low HDL (&lt;34 mg/dL) and elevated triglycerides (&gt;204 mg/dL). AIM-HIGH was a study designed to evaluate the cardiovascular outcomes with niacin and statin combination therapy compared to statin monotherapy in patients with coronary heart disease, including a subgroup with diabetes. The study was stopped early in 2011 because of lack of benefit compared to statin therapy alone, including the diabetes subgroup [Moderate Quality Evidence].</p>

<p gate:gateId="367">Uncontrolled hypertension is a major cardiovascular risk factor that also accelerates the progression of diabetic nephropathy [Low Quality Evidence]. When hypertension is identified, it should be aggressively treated to achieve a target blood pressure of less than 140/90 mm Hg. <Condition gate:gateId="1437" string="In many patients with diabetes" activities="1297" instance="http://brigid/mhb-f#In_many_patients_with_diabetes"><TAK_Condition gate:gateId="205172" takId="204740" takConceptName="diabetes" instance="http://brigid/mhb-f#In_many_patients_with_diabetes" string="In many patients with diabetes" activities="1297" takConceptType="RawNominalConcept">In many patients with diabetes</TAK_Condition></Condition> , <Activity gate:gateId="1297" string="two or three or more antihypertensive agents may be needed" hasType="drug-administration" instance="http://brigid/mhb-f#two_or_three_or_more_antihypertensive_agents_may_be_needed">two or three or more antihypertensive agents may be needed</Activity> to achieve this goal. The use of generic combination tablets (such as angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitor plus calcium-channel blocker, or beta-blocker plus diuretic) can reduce the complexity of the regimen and out-of-pocket costs.</p>

<p gate:gateId="368">Several studies support a systolic blood pressure goal &lt;140 mm Hg for people with type 2 diabetes. The work group would estimate that targeting a systolic blood pressure &lt;140 mm Hg would result in an achieved blood pressure around 135 mm Hg for most people.</p>

<p gate:gateId="369">The work group acknowledges that the evidence is not definitive for any particular general blood pressure goal for patients with diabetes. The work group feels that a blood pressure goal of &lt;140/90 mm Hg is reasonable and defensible based on the evidence previously presented. This goal is also consistent with the current blood pressure measure for people with diabetes specified by the Physician Quality Reporting System. See https://www.cms.gov/PQRS for more information. The work group will continue to review the blood pressure goal to consider any new evidence and the recommendations of other national practice guidelines (e.g., American Diabetes Association [ADA] and the Eighth Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure [JNC8]) that are expected to announce revisions. The general recommendation of blood pressure &lt;140/90 mm Hg does not preclude setting individual patient goals lower than that based on patient characteristics, comorbidities, risks or the preference of an informed patient.</p>

<p gate:gateId="370">Refer to Table 2 in the original guideline document for comparison of goal versus mean achieved blood pressure levels in randomized trials of blood pressure control in people with type 2 diabetes.</p>

<p gate:gateId="371">While ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are preferred first-line therapy, two or more agents (to include thiazide diuretics) may be required. For patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, thiazide diuretics in the treatment of hypertension can reduce cardiovascular events, particularly heart failure.

<h6 gate:gateId="372">Aspirin/Antiplatelet Medication Optional [Moderate Quality Evidence]</h6>

<p gate:gateId="373">Patients with type 2 diabetes are at a significantly increased risk for development of heart disease [Guideline]. There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against aspirin use in the primary prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes, although there is no evidence of significant harm. [Conclusion Grade I: See Conclusion Grading Worksheet D - Annotations #13, 14 (Aspirin Use) in the original guideline document]. Recent trials of aspirin use in diabetes have shown less benefit than older trials (perhaps due to better background A1c, blood pressure, and low-density lipoprotein control and lower smoking rates in recent trials) [High Quality Evidence]. Results of an aspirin meta-analysis in 2012 shows no significant benefits of aspirin for primary prevention. There are significant limitations identified in these studies, and more definitive studies would be helpful. [Meta-analysis]. Therefore, based on current evidence, low-dose aspirin is considered optional for primary prevention.</p>

<p gate:gateId="396">This recommendation places a very high value on a multifactorial approach to lowering the cardiovascular risk of patients with diabetes. The recommendation does not place value on prioritizing these treatment interventions, and some may be more important than others for different individuals. For the lipid and blood pressure recommendations, there is low value placed on the burden of these treatment approaches, the age of the patient (the evidence is less established in patients under age 40 and over 75), and whether patients can tolerate the treatments needed to obtain the recommended goals without side effects. The aspirin recommendation places high value on the benefits of aspirin for secondary prevention of cardiovascular events compared to the risks of bleeding.</p>

<h4 gate:gateId="408">Are Treatment Goals Met?</h4>

<p gate:gateId="409">Major long-term goals of care in type 2 diabetes are cardiovascular disease prevention and achieving optimal glycemic control (see the related Glycemic Control algorithm annotations).</p>

<p gate:gateId="410">Setting initial goals that are achievable, however modest they may be, may encourage patients to take further steps along the way to the more ambitious long-term goals.</p>

<p gate:gateId="411">Goals and progress towards agreed-upon goals should be briefly reviewed at each office visit for diabetes. Adjustment of goals will likely be required over time, and patient involvement in this process can increase levels of patient involvement in care, give patients a greater sense of control of their diabetes, and allow flexibility in management of diabetes during periods of high stress or major life transitions.</p>

<p gate:gateId="426">Non-adherence with medications can limit the success of therapy and help to explain why a patient is not achieving treatment goals. To screen for non-adherence, clinicians can ask patients open-ended, non-threatening questions at each office visit.

<p gate:gateId="431">Interventions to enhance medication adherence should be directed at risk factors or causes of non-adherence.

<p gate:gateId="434">Identification and management of depression is an important aspect of diabetes care. Self-administered or professionally administered instruments (such as the Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ]-9) are useful adjuncts to the clinical interview in the identification of depression. The NGC summary of the ICSI guideline Major Depression in Adults in Primary Care provides more suggestions for the management of depression. Intervention studies have demonstrated that when depression is treated, both quality of life and glycemic control improve. Counseling may be effective, especially among those who are having difficulty adjusting to the diagnosis of diabetes or are having difficulty living with diabetes. Pharmacotherapy for depression is also effective.</p>

<h6 gate:gateId="496">Retinopathy</h6>

<p gate:gateId="497">Prevalence of retinopathy is related to the duration of diabetes mellitus. After 20 years of type 2 diabetes mellitus, more than 60% of patients have some degree of retinopathy [Guideline]. Diabetic retinopathy is estimated to be the most frequent cause of new cases of blindness among adults ages 20 to 74 years.</p>

<p gate:gateId="498">Up to 21% of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus are found to have retinopathy at the time of diagnosis of diabetes mellitus [Guideline]. Generally retinopathy progresses from mild background abnormalities to preproliferative retinopathy to proliferative retinopathy.</p>

<p gate:gateId="499">Poor glucose control is associated with progression of retinopathy. High blood pressure is a risk factor for the development of macular edema and is associated with the development of proliferative retinopathy [Guideline].</p>

<p gate:gateId="500">Screening for diabetic retinopathy saves vision at a relatively low cost. In fact, screening costs may be less than the costs of disability payments for those who become blind. Laser photocoagulation surgery is effective in preventing visual loss in diabetic retinopathy.</p>

<p gate:gateId="501">Studies have shown that retinal examinations by clinicians who are not eye care specialists are not reliable in detecting retinopathy [Guideline, High Quality Evidence, Consensus Statement, Low Quality Evidence, Narrative Review].</p>

However, no single, adequately powered intent-to-treat randomized control trial has shown a benefit of this blood pressure goal in CKD [High Quality Evidence], [Meta-analysis], [Systematic Review]. Hence, the recommendation for lower blood pressure goals in all patients with CKD is based on expert opinion and not fully supported by available prospective clinical trials. Determining whether therapy should specifically be titrated to goals lower than 140/90 mm Hg for specific subgroups of CKD patients (e.g., those with moderate proteinuria) should be considered on an individual patient basis, based on clinical judgment and patient preference.</li>

<p gate:gateId="588">A recent consensus statement of the American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes recommended concurrent initiation of metformin with medical nutrition therapy for most patients at diagnosis. Arguments for this approach include the infrequent success of medical nutrition therapy alone, and the absence of weight gain and hypoglycemia, general tolerability and relatively low cost of metformin [Reference]. Metformin, sulfonylurea medications and insulin were recommended in this consensus statement as well-validated core therapies based on their extended history of use, demonstrated effectiveness and generally favorable cost. More recent therapies such as thiazolidinediones and glucagon-like peptide 1 agonists were viewed as less-well-validated therapies. The authors of the consensus statement note that there are few well-controlled clinical trials directly comparing different diabetes treatment regimens and that their recommendations are in part based on clinical experience [Guideline]. Clinician judgment and factors such as patient comorbidities, patient desires and cost considerations should always guide design of a glycemic control regimen at the individual patient level.</p>

<p gate:gateId="590">It is important to remember that patients can move both ways on the Glycemic Control algorithm (e.g., they can move off of specific pharmacologic therapies as lifestyle changes are made that improve glycemic control). Diabetes is a progressive disease, however, and the use of pharmacologic agents will likely become necessary in the majority of patients, even if they are able to follow through with nutrition and physical activity recommendations [High Quality Evidence].</p>

<p gate:gateId="591">Only general guidelines can be given when deciding about which pharmacologic agent will be best for a specific patient. While each patient presents with unique circumstances, the work group offers the following clinical circumstances to consider.</p>
<h6 gate:gateId="592">Age of Patient</h6>

<p gate:gateId="593">It is important to recognize that risks of medications are often increased with advancing age, but this does not justify the withholding of medications that may reduce the symptoms of polyuria, and nocturia.</p>

<p gate:gateId="594">With age, decline in renal function is often not reflected in a measurable change in serum creatinine because of an accompanying decline in muscle mass. Because of this, metformin should be used with caution in elderly patients (over age 80).</p>

<p gate:gateId="595">Decline in ventricular function and risks for volume overload can be occult in the elderly and may become clinically apparent with the use of thiazolidinediones.</p>

<h6 gate:gateId="597">Weight of the Patient</h6>

<p gate:gateId="598">Type 2 diabetes is often associated with insulin resistance and weight gain. Metformin, acarbose, exenatide, sitagliptin, and human amylin are more often associated with weight loss or weight maintenance. Due to its weight benefits as well as general tolerability, lower cost and proven benefits in UK Prospective Diabetes Study Group, metformin is recommended for most diabetes patients with type 2 diabetes unless contraindicated. Insulin and thiazolidinediones may be associated with weight gain [High Quality Evidence].</p>
<h6 gate:gateId="599">Renal Dysfunction</h6>

<p gate:gateId="600">Renal dysfunction increases the risk for hypoglycemia, in particular with the use of oral hypoglycemic agents.</p>

<p gate:gateId="601">Metformin and alpha glucosidase inhibitors should not be used.</p>

<p gate:gateId="602">Thiazolidinediones may be considered, but the potential risks of fluid retention and increased risk of cardiac events need to be considered.</p>

<p gate:gateId="603">Short-acting oral agents glipizide, glimepiride (in which serum levels have been noted to decrease in mild renal failure), repaglinide, or nateglinide may be preferred if an oral agent is felt to be necessary in the face of renal dysfunction.</p>

<p gate:gateId="604">Insulin may be the safest when serum creatinine is greater than 1.8 mg or creatinine clearance is less than 60 mL/min.</p>
<h6 gate:gateId="605">Cardiopulmonary Comorbidities</h6>

<p gate:gateId="606">Metformin should be used with caution in patients with conditions that predispose them to risk of hypoxia such as congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or obstructive sleep apnea. <Activity gate:gateId="1374" string="Metformin should be promptly discontinued" instance="http://brigid/mhb-f#Metformin_should_be_promptly_discontinued">Metformin should be promptly discontinued</Activity> <Condition gate:gateId="1493" instance="http://brigid/mhb-f#in_situations_of_cardiovascular_collapse_from_acute_congestive_heart_failure,_acute_myocardial_infar" string="in situations of cardiovascular collapse from acute congestive heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, or any other cause" hasConditionType="ending-condition" activities="1374"><TAK_Condition gate:gateId="205227" instance="http://brigid/mhb-f#in_situations_of_cardiovascular_collapse_from_acute_congestive_heart_failure,_acute_myocardial_infar" string="in situations of cardiovascular collapse from acute congestive heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, or any other cause" activities="1374" takConceptType="ValueAbstractionConcept" takId="205128" takConceptName="cardiovascular collapse from acute congestive heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, or any other cause" hasConditionType="ending-condition">in situations of cardiovascular collapse from acute congestive heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, or any other cause</TAK_Condition></Condition> .</p>

<p gate:gateId="608">Short-acting sulfonylurea (e.g., glipizide), repaglinide/nateglinide, and the cautious use of long-acting sulfonylurea oral agents, or insulin may be safest.</p>

Many patients can be taught to interpret self-monitoring blood glucose results and adjust insulin doses [Guideline]. (See table showing the time course of action of insulin preparations in the original guideline document.)</li>
<li gate:gateId="620">Total dose ranges from 5 units/day to several hundred units/day.</li>

<br gate:gateId="1534"></br>A recent three-year randomized, multicenter, open label trial that studied the efficacy of three different insulin regimens in over 700 patients with type 2 diabetes who had A1c values &gt;7% on maximum doses of metformin and a sulfonylurea, suggests the following: <ul gate:gateId="625"><li gate:gateId="626">Various insulin regimens can be effective in treating type 2 diabetes.</li>
<li gate:gateId="627">An insulin regimen based initially on one or two injections a day of a longer-acting insulin may be associated with less hypoglycemia and/or less weight gain compared to regimens initiated with fixed-ratio or rapid-acting insulin [High Quality Evidence].</li>
</ul></li>
<li gate:gateId="628">Rapid-acting insulin should not be taken more than 15 minutes before meals in contrast to regular insulin, which should ideally be taken at least 30 minutes before a meal to better match the insulin peak action with post-meal hyperglycemia.</li>
<li gate:gateId="629">Patients who are testing their glucose before meals and adjusting insulin doses to match meals may find rapid-acting insulin to be more effective although generally studies have not shown an improvement in A1c when compared to regular insulin taken according to package insert (30 to 45 minutes preprandial).</li>
